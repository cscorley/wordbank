wordbank
========

Keywords! Reserved words! *"You will find all the words in the wordbank at the top of the page."*

## what

This project is here as a collection of all keywords and reserved words known to mankind.
I am attempting to collect a repository of programming languages and their words.

Everything is coded into JSON dictionaries right now, where each key is the *kind* of keywords they are and the values are a list of those words. This may vary application to application, so I'll leave that decision up to you.

## why

I do research in software engineering, and in particular, a lot of it revolves around text mining source code.
[Stop words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words) are commonly used to filter out noise from programming language data.
I need a *wordbank* established for languages so I can do cool, non-language specific stuff (see any threats to validity section in software studies, ever).

## how

Like this: fork & pull request me!

The repository structure still needs work, but I'm confident something good can come of it.

So far, I've extracted all of the terms from grammars and syntax highlighters.
My intuition is that if it's important enough to be highlighted, then it should be included in the 'bank.

They're just word lists, okay? So can you just not?
