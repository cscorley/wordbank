wordbank
========

Keywords! Reserved words! *"You will find all the words in the wordbank at the top of the page."*

## what

This project is here as a collection of all keywords and reserved words known to mankind.
I am attempting to collect a repository of programming languages and their words.

## why

I do research in software engineering, and in particular, a lot of it revolves around text mining source code.
[Stop words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words) are commonly used to filter out noise from programming language data.
I need a *wordbank* established for languages so I can do cool, non-language specific stuff (see any threats to validity section in software studies, ever).

## how

Like this: fork & pull request me!

The repository structure still needs work, but I'm confident something good can come of it.

They're just word lists, okay? So can you just not?
